<h1>Welcome to LEM - A text-based language for <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML</h1>
<h2>What is LEM?</h2>
<p>
LEM is a <b>L</b>anguage for <b>E</b>xecutable <b>M</b>odels. 
Read the <a href="src/realEstate.lem">sample model</a> to get a feel for LEM and 
peruse the <a href="doc/jjdoc/LemParser.html">LEM grammar specification</a>
<p>The goal is to be
able to express complete <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML models in a plain text
language. LEM defines <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML models without the reliance on
UML graphics (diagrams). The motivation for a plain text representation are:

<ul>
<li>
plain text easier to understand when compared to UML diagrams
</LI>
<li>
plain text can be searched by Google (and other text-based search engines)
</LI>
<li>
version control is facilitated (try diff'ing UML diagrams)
</LI>
<li>
models can be recorded and modified with a simple text editor
</LI>
</UL>

Plain text models are a power and expressive tool which encourage full
engagement of the non-modelling domain experts during the modelling process. 

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
The objectives of this project is to
<ol>
  <li>define the <a href="doc/jjdoc/LemParser.html">grammar for LEM</a></li>
  <li>develop a parser for the language</li>
  <li>explore the use of LEM and the parser in the context of an open source <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML toolkit </li>
</ol>
<p>
As a broad objective, an <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML model expressed in LEM
should be easy to read and covey significant concepts to all readers.

<h2>Project directory</h2>
The project directory consists of a number of sub-directories:

<h2>Try it out</h2>
Attach to the <b>src</b> directory and enter <br><b><pre>java Lem realEstate.lem</pre></b>
<br>
Read the <a href="src/realEstate.lem">sample model</a> to get a feel for LEM and check out the <a href="doc/jjdoc/LemParser.html">grammar specification</a>

<h2>Status</h2>
The project is in its early stages. The initial goal is to establish a working
language definition that covers the main elements of
<sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML. Once the LEM definition is reasonably complete, and
we have a parser, the language constructs will be reviewed by testing against
real-world <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML model.
<p>
The status so far is summaried in terms of <sup>X</sup><sub>T</sub>UML elements

<h3>Done and working:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gross structures (Model, domains, subsystems)</li>
<li>Core data types</li>
<li>Domain types</li>
<li>Class definition with class attributes</li>
<li>Generalisation relationships</li>
<li>Associations (with multiplicity and verb clause annotations)</li>
<li>Association classes</li>
</ol>
<p>
The parser will parse an LEM language input file and build a JAVA object graph
representing the model.  Some aspects of static verification have been included
but there is a lot to do.

<h3>Coming soon:</h3>
<ol>
<li>State machine, states, events and transitions</li>
<li>Action language (state procedures)</li>
<li>OCL</li>
<li>Static verification</li>
</ol>
