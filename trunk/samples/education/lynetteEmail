Shayne's quote from his UML reference manual " - it connects two OR MORE
classes" is key.  In entity relationship modelling (and Chen Diagrams)
you CAN have ternary relationships - I'm not sure if you can have higher
numbers as all my database books are in the office.

Although data modellers are generally told to model data using only
binary models, this can create awkward situations when dealing with
three or more entities that have clear relational interdependencies. For
example, you could model the classic student, teacher, class scenario
with a one to many relationship between teacher and class and a many to
many relationship between class and student.=20

This assumes that a class has one teacher and many students. A teacher
may teach many classes. A student may take many classes. This structure
is not the most elegant, however. If one wishes to know what students a
teacher teaches, one must navigate the question through class by asking
something like, "What classes does the teacher teach, and what students
take those classes?".

However, a neater and more elegant way of modelling this would be to
have all three objects participating in the same relationship.=20

In the first example using binary relationships, extra notation is
necessary to show the optionality and cardinality of the relationships
modelled so that the semantics of the overall structure may be
represented. In the second, however, it is clear that teachers, classes,
and students are in a combined relationship that requires less notation
to represent. Using that model, it becomes possible to ask simply,
"Which students does this teacher teach?"

However, the rules of normalisation usually followed in relational
theory would not allow this model to be implemented because there is no
simple way to represent a ternary relationship.

In each case you would end up with the same implementation - 4 tables:
student, teacher, class and enrolment.  In example one you need the
enrolment table to implement the many to many relationship between
student and class.  The second example also requires the enrolment table
to represent the ternary relationship.=20

Therefore you would end up implementing four tables something like this.


Teacher - with a primary key of, say, Faculty ID
Class  - with a primary key of ClassID and a column called FacultyID
that is a foreign key reference to the Teacher table. (Because Class is
not dependent on Teacher, the foreign key reference is not part of its
primary key.)
Student - has a primary key of StudentID.=20
Enrolment - is a cross-reference table that has a compound primary key,
one element of which (ClassID) is a foreign key reference to the Class
table and the other of which (StudentID) is a foreign key reference to
the Student table.=20

Does Bridgepoint support ternary relationships?

Don't know what all this means in terms of xtUML and what Greg is trying
to prove, but ternary relationship are legal in entity-relationship
modelling and chen diagrams.

Annette and I checked the BridgePoint metamodel - it matches Starr's and
the=20
'an' in Mellor&Balcer. The tool doesn't seem to implement it's
documented=20
metamodel

According to my new UML Reference Manual (2nd Edition), "An association
class=20
is an association that is also a class" ... " - it connects two or more=20
classes". This makes sense in full UML because it UML associations can
be=20
n-ary.=20

xtUML only supports binary associations. So in our case, and association
class=20
is _a_ binary association.
